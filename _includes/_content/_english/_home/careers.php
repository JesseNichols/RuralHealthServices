        <h3>NHSC Loan Repayment Program</h3>
        <p>RHS, Inc. also is a participant of the NHSC Loan Repayment Program</p>
        <p>The National Health Service Corps (NHSC) offers tax-free loan repayment assistance to support qualified health care providers who choose to take their skills where theyâ€™re most needed.</p>
        <p>Licensed health care providers may earn up to $50,000 toward student loans in exchange for a two-year commitment at an NHSC-approved site through the <a href="http://nhsc.hrsa.gov/loanrepayment/loanrepaymentprogram.html" target="_blank">NHSC Loan Repayment Program (NHSC LRP)</a>.</p>
        <p>Accepted participants may serve as primary care medical, dental, or mental/behavioral health clinicians and can choose to serve longer for additional loan repayment support.</p>
        <p>Priority consideration is given to eligible applicants whose NHSC-approved site has a HPSA score of 26 to 14, in descending order. Eligible applicants may receive up to $50,000 in loan repayment for an initial service commitment until funding is exhausted.</p>
